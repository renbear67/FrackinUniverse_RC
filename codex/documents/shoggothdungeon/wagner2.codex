"MacReady has been acting strange lately. I can't place my finger on it, but ever since that...thing...fell under his operating knife he's changed. It's unsettling.",

"We've confined MacReady to the labs. He's totally lost it. At least we can seal the door remotely and he can be holed up with that...thing.

I'll need a ^orange;grappling hook of some sort^white; to make any real progress."
